## Installation

#### Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 + Python 3.10 + Pytorch 2.5.1 + cu12.4

Prepare environment:
```
conda create -n vlipp python=3.10
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
conda activate vlipp
mkdir data
```
You need to install GroundedSAM2 follow the instruction in [Grounded-SAM-2](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-SAM-2).

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start.
### Stage1: Coarse-Level Motion Planning
If you have an OpenAI API key, you can put the API key in scripts/inference/run_stage1.sh or set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. Then you can use OpenAI's API for planning a physically plausible motion trajectory, with GPT-4o as an example:
```
bash scripts/inference/run_stage1.sh
```
### Stage2: Fine-Level Motion Synthesis
Then, you can use the coarse-level motion planned by the VLM in the previous stage to guide the video diffusion model in synthesizing a physically plausible video.
```
bash scripts/inference/run_stage2.sh
```

Note that since we provide some caches for stage 1, you don't need to run stage 1 on your own for cached prompts that we provide (i.e., you don't need an OpenAI API key).

```
bash scripts/cached_example/ball_cube_collide.sh
bash scripts/cached_example/pour_juice.sh
bash scripts/cached_example/mug_fall.sh
```

## Coarse Motion Guidance for Physically Plausible Video Generation

Coarse motion trajectories planned by the VLM can serve as motion priors, guiding video-diffusion models to generate physically plausible videos.
